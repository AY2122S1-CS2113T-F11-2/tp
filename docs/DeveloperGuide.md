## Design 

### Architecture
![Figure_Architecture_Diagram](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

At app launch, **`BudgetTracker`** is in charge of initializing the components and linking them by passing some 
initialized components into others as parameters. 

For example, an initialized variable of `Data` is passed into an initialized variable of `Storage` for
the `Storage` component to load hard disk information into the memory.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) consists of the exception classes for exception handling and messages used by other classes.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The User Interface of the App -- Reads User Input and displays queried data.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): Parses User Input and executes the corresponding command.
* [**`Data`**](#data-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `add -e m/1 a/500`.

### UI Component
**API**: [`ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/budgettracker/ui)

![Figure_UiComponent_Component_Diagram](images/UiComponent.png)

The `Ui` component:
- Reads in user input from the Command Line Interface (CLI).
- Prints welcome screen, database information and messages prompting the user for input.
- Other components call methods in Ui class to print corresponding output on the terminal.

### Data Component
Below is a partial class diagram that shows an overview of the `Data` component.

## Implementation

### Delete - Basic Command Logic

The delete feature collaborates with other classes like Parser, RecordList, etc. Basically it contains three usages which are deletion of Budget, Expenditure(s), and Loan(s).

For example, when user keys ```delete -b m/MONTH```, The Parser class will analyse the whole command, and extract “b/” and “MONTH”. Then the class DeleteBudgetCommand will execute the deletion by using recordList.deleteBudget(MONTH).

A more specific example with sequence diagram will be given at the end of this section.

Similarly, we have our Parser to parse the commands for deletion of expenditures and loans:
* ```delete -e m/MONTH``` — If there's no index value specified in the input, we use for loop to delete all expenditures within a month.
* ```delete -e m/MONTH i/INDEX``` — If the value at the position after ‘i/’ is an integer, we use DeleteSingleExpenditureCommand to delete this specific expenditure in this specific month.
* ```delete -e m/MONTH i/INDEX-INDEX``` — If the value at the position after ‘i/’ is a range of integers, we firstly use split[] to extract the starting and ending integers, and then we use DeleteMultipleExpenditureCommand to delete the expenditures in this range in this specific month. (also by using for loop)

<br/>

All the delete command classes (DeleteAllExpenditureCommand, DeleteSingleExpenditureCommand, DeleteMultipleExpenditureCommand, and DeleteBudgetCommand) extend from DeleteCommand class, and DeleteCommand class extends from Command class. Inside each command class, we have a constructor and an override function called execute to execute the specific deletion task assigned to them.

<br/>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete feature behaves at each step.

<br/>

**Step 1**. The user launches the application for the first time.
<br/> **Step 2**. The user adds a budget and some expenditures to the current month.
<br/> **Step 3**. The user finds that the budget is a bit insufficient, thus the user wants to delete some expenditures.
<br/> **Step 4**. After consideration, the user decides to delete expenditure 3-5, so he keys ```delete -e m/10 i/3-5``` for Parser class to parse:
* ```parseCommand(String userInput)``` specifies the user input as a delete command, then calls the method ```prepareDeleteCommand(String commandParams)``` inside the class.
* By using substring method, description, indexes, and month of the expenditures are extracted in ```deleteParams```, ```prepareDeleteCommand(commandParams)``` calls ```DeleteExpenditureParser.parse(deleteParams)``` to parse the params more specifically.
* Method ```parse(String args)``` in class ```DeleteExpenditureParser``` returns newly created object ```DeleteMultipleExpenditureCommand(startIndex, endIndex, month)```.
<br/>
  ![Figure Delete_Parse](images/parseDeleteInputCommand-Sequence_Diagram.png)

**Step 5**. The newly created object ```DeleteExpenditureCommand``` will execute the deletion:
* ```execute(boolean isLoadinStorage)``` runs a for loop to delete the related expenditures in the expenditure ArrayList.
* ```for(int i = startIndex; i <= endIndex; i++)``` iterates the 3 expenditures, everytime it just calls ```allRecordList.deleteExpenditure(startIndex, month)``` to delete each expenditure.
<br/>

### Edit feature

The edit mechanism is facilitated by AllRecordList which extends from RecordList. It implements the following operations:
* ```AllRecordList#editBudget()``` — Edits a budget to the record list.
* ```AllRecordList#editExpenditure()``` — Edits an expenditure to the record list.
* ```AllRecordList#editLoan()``` —Edits a loan record to the record list.

<br/>

These operations are exposed in the ```EditBudgetCommand```, ```EditExpenditureCommand``` and ```EditLoanCommand``` classes, which extend from the ```Command``` subclass as ```EditBudget#execute()```, ```EditExpenditure#execute()``` and ```EditLoan#execute()``` respectively.

<br/>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the ```edit``` mechanism behaves at each step.

<br/>

**Step 1**. The user launches the application for the first time. The ```AllRecordList``` will be initialized with the initial record list state.
<br/> **Step 2**. The user executes add …  to ```add``` a new record into the record list. The add command also calls Storage#saveToStorage(), causing a modified record list state to be saved into the storage file.
<br/> **Step 3**. The user now realises that there was a mistake in the record added, and decides to edit the record by executing the ```edit``` command. The edit command will call ```AllRecordList#edit…``` based on the record type.


### Listing

The list feature works with Parser, Recordlist and TextUi, and allows users to see the listing of the budget and expenditures in either a specific month or every month.

When user keys ```list m/Month [c/CATEGORY]```, The Parser class will analyse the whole command, extract "m/", "MONTH", "c/" and "CATEGORY", analyse whether MONTH is an integer or “all”, and check whether CATEGORY has been assigned. The boolean isListAll will be assigned as true if the value after “m/” is “all”. Then the class ListRecordsCommand will execute the listing by using TextUi.showRecordsListView(recordList, MONTH, isListAll)).

Similarly, we have our Parser to parse the commands for listing of expenditures
* ```list m/Month [c/CATEGORY]``` — If the value at the position after ‘m/’ is an integer, we use hashtable to list the budget and all expenditures of a  specific month.
* ```list m/all [[c/CATEGORY]``` — If the value at the position after ‘m/’ is “all”, we use for loop to list all the budget and expenditures of every month.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list feature behaves at each step.

**Step 1**. The user launches the application for the first time.
<br/> **Step 2**. The user adds a budget and some expenditures to the current month.
<br/> **Step 3**. The user forgets what the budget and expenditures added, thus the user wants to see the budget and the list of the expenditures.
<br/> **Step 4**. After consideration, the user decides to see the budget and list of May, so he keys ```list m/5```
<br/> **Step 5**. The Parser starts to parse the command, it extracts month 5. As this is a specific month to be listed, the Parser class calls ListRecordsCommand to work. By finding May, the expenditures list and budget of May are successfully found and prints out a showRecordsListView from TextUi class.


### Storage 

The storage stores the exact add command of budget and expenditures into the text file containing 
in the current ArrayList. The reason it is implemented in this manner is that we could reuse
code that have been written for adding of budget and expenditures directly when loading from storage.

Everytime a deleted, edit or add command is called, the txt file is automatically wiped and re-written 
from the ArrayList to ensure that data is saved at every step. 

The yearly Records is stored in the form of <year>.txt. Each year contains all the monthly budget as
well as all the expenditure tied to that month.
