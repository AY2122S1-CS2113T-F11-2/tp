### Project: Budget Tracker

Budget Tracker is a desktop app for managing expenses, budget and loans, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) for tech-savvy students who have trouble keeping track of their expenses.


Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added an edit command for expenditures and loans
  * What it does:  that allows the user to edit their previously added expenditure and loan records.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should allow the user to rectify his mistakes easily.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
* **New Feature**: Added an add command for adding loans
  * What it does:  allows users to add a loan record to their list.

* **Project management**:
    * Managed releases `v1.0` - `v2.1` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Added Parser ability to parse any type of User input into understandable commands
    * Created a RecordList class for storing management of records.

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the some parts in features `delete` and `edit` [\#72]()
    * Developer Guide:
        * Added implementation details of the `edit` feature.
        
Still editing:
* **Community**:
    * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#12](), [\#32](), [\#19](), [\#42]()
    * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
    * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())

* **Tools**:
    * Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project ([\#42]())
    * Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo
